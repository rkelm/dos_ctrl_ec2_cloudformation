# To-Do:

- Create TEST remote config file on s3
# 188892360808.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/mc_srv_ctrl:0.3
# mc-host-cf.ps-ev.de.


- Integrate into dos_ctrl_ec2 + dos_ec2_docker_minecraft
	- Create prepare.bat to run setup-template.json (Fixed named stack)
	- Create unprepare.bat to remove stack of setup-templage.json
	- launch stack
	- terminate stack
	- TEST Run MC Vanilla
		- Fix setup-template policy: Add route53 + ec2 + s3 list-objects
		- Create Policy for AppRunner User in setup-template.json
		- OnDeleteStack: Save Running Map!
		- Test MC commands from dos_ctrl_docker_minecraft

- Make DNSHOSTNAME optional in run_Template.json

- Test not defining a SSH Key
	- Remove SSH (Port20)  from security group if no key given.

- Setup cron to install security patches?
	- create admin script that is called every 6 hours.
   - Relogin in to aws ecr, after 11 hours or before loading a new image?
      $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region eu-central-1)
   - yum update?
   - Setup cron job with SNS reminder Mail, that server is running, in docker container?


- Bug? srv_ctrl: run-map.sh: Filters on ec2 on tagkey and tagvalue to determine running map.
  Shouldn't this only by filtered by Tagkey, as a map could else be running on on KID1 and KID2
  at the same time?

- What to do with remaining parameters?
	- Create Batch file to create new configs with compatible software version numbers?
	  As part of setup_server.bat?
	- master configuration with code versions? (AMI IDs, etc.)

- setup-template: Managed Policy: Add statements to allow setting of route53.

- Write Setup instructions
	- Setup ECR
		- setup resource based policy 

- Add IPv6 support.
   - security group
   - instance ssh
   - MC server

- Bug: dos_ctrl_ec2: Kick.bat not working. Window closes too fast?

- CF Template to create S3 Buckets -> move to overviewer project
	- mc-private/maps  (Keep secrets here?)
	- mc-render-cache/render-cache
	- mc-public/map-renders (Better keep map_ids.txt + configuration in separate Bucket?)
		- /resource-packs
		- /index.html
		- /map_ids.txt
		- /robots.txt
