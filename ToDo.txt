# To-Do:

- Pass configuration of setup_route_53.py by env vars
  - hostedzoneID is needed -> Look it up via aws cli when not in config file?
  - No error when config file is missing. Simply print a warning.
  - for docker image no aws credentials needed.
  - in setup_route_53.py only pass credentials when
    provided via environment or config file

- Integrate into dos_ctrl_ec2 + dos_ec2_docker_minecraft
	- TEST Run test spigot
	- Rename / Integrate / Test MC commands from dos_ctrl_docker_minecraft
		- docmc_cmd
		- docmc_launch
		- terminate
		- savemap
		- runmap
		- Kick
		- punish
		- whitelist 3x
	- OnDeleteStack: Save Running Map!

- Make DNSHOSTNAME optional in run_Template.json

- Test not defining a SSH Key
	- Remove SSH (Port20)  from security group if no key given.

- Test prepare and unprepare of stack.

- Create Policy for AppRunner User in setup-template.json
	- Pass SSM Role 
	{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "iam:ListRoles",
        "iam:PassRole"
    ],
    "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role-for-XYZ"

- 13.2
	- Update Spigot + Spigot WE docker images
	- Update other maps to 

- Verify that deleting of old cache remote config works.
- What to do with remaining parameters?
	- Create Batch file to create new configs with compatible software version numbers?
	  As part of setup_server.bat?
	- master configuration with code versions? (AMI IDs, etc.)

- secure configs
	- image building: /vagrant/set...
	- clients
	- How to distribute? Via s3, samba?

- Release 0.1
	- Test build.bat
	- Build package
	- Publish client install package
	- Prepare client configs
	- Deploy to clients
	- Update MC Clients with VoxelMap

- Write Setup instructions
	- Setup ECR
		- setup resource based policy 

- Setup Murmur server 
https://hub.docker.com/r/goofball222/murmur/

https://github.com/mattikus/docker-murmur


- Add IPv6 support.
   - security group
   - instance ssh
   - MC server

- Bug: dos_ctrl_ec2: Kick.bat not working. Window closes too fast?

- CF Template to create S3 Buckets -> move to overviewer project
	- mc-private/maps  (Keep secrets here?)
	- mc-render-cache/render-cache
	- mc-public/map-renders (Better keep map_ids.txt + configuration in separate Bucket?)
